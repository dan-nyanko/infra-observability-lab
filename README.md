## Infra Observability Lab

A hands-on DevOps lab exploring infrastructure provisioning, observability tooling, incident simulation, and CI/CD workflows—built on GCP for learning and experimentation.

---

### Project Overview

This lab demonstrates key platform engineering principles using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, and GitHub Actions. It’s designed as a sandbox for exploring:

- Infrastructure-as-code provisioning
- Observability-first system design
- Incident simulation and recovery workflows
- CI/CD hygiene and automation

---

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)  
*A GCP-hosted GKE Autopilot cluster runs Prometheus and Grafana. Metrics are collected from simulated workloads and exposed via exporters. Alerts trigger based on thresholds, and incident simulations validate recovery paths.*

### 🔧 Components

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `terraform/` | Provisions GKE Autopilot cluster and supporting resources |
| `monitoring/` | Prometheus config, Grafana dashboard, alerting rules |
| `incidents/` | Bash/Python scripts to simulate CPU spikes, disk fill, etc. |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI/CD pipeline with linting, testing, and deploy stages |
| `architecture.png` | Visual diagram of system flow |
| `README.md` | Documentation and reliability framing |

### Environment Strategy

In production-grade GCP environments, it’s a best practice to use separate projects for each environment (e.g., development, staging, production). This enables:

•  Clear isolation of resources and IAM policies
•  Environment-specific billing and quotas
•  Safer CI/CD pipelines and policy enforcement

#### Lab Context

For this lab, all resources are provisioned into a single GCP project to simplify setup and reduce cost. To simulate environment separation, we apply consistent [GCP resource labels](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels) labels applied via Terraform.

> When scaling this lab into a production-like setup, consider using one GCP project per environment and managing shared configuration via Terraform workspaces, modules, or a multi-project structure.

#### Example label schema:

| Key           | Value               | Purpose                                  |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `environment` | `development`       | Signals lifecycle stage                  |
| `purpose`     | `observability-lab` | Context for dashboards and billing       |
| `managed-by`  | `terraform`         | Shows infra-as-code ownership            |

These labels are defined in `variables.tf` and applied to all supported resources via the `resource_labels` map.

#### Example usage in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "autopilot" {
  name     = var.cluster_name
  location = var.region
  enable_autopilot = true

  ...

  resource_labels = var.resource_labels
}
```

### Prerequisites

#### Install Terraform (macOS)

```bash
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

Verify installation:

```bash
terraform -version
```

> For other platforms, see [Terraform Downloads](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)

#### Install gcloud CLI

```bash
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

Authenticate and set your project:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project your-project-id
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
```

---

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dan-nyanko/infra-observability-lab.git
cd infra-observability-lab
```

#### 2. Configure `terraform.tfvars`

```hcl
project_id   = "your-gcp-project-id"
region       = "us-central1"
cluster_name = "observability-lab"
```

Place this file in the `terraform/` directory.

#### 3. Provision GKE Autopilot

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

#### 4. Deploy Prometheus + Grafana

```bash
kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus.yml
kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json
```

#### 5. Run Incident Simulation

```bash
bash incidents/simulate_cpu_spike.sh
```

> Observe alerts in Grafana and document recovery steps using `postmortem-template.md`.

### Reliability Principles

This lab reinforces:
- **Observability-first design**: Metrics, dashboards, and alerting from day one
- **Infrastructure as code**: Declarative provisioning with Terraform
- **Incident culture**: Simulations, postmortems, and recovery workflows
- **CI/CD hygiene**: Automated linting, testing, and deploys via GitHub Actions
